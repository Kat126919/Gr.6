<p> When I start this journal, I wanted to thanks my parent who give me the chance to come to Canada, I know this has always been your dream since you're very young, but unfortunately you didn't get the chance when you're young and you had to wait until all the hard work over the years to be able to come to Canada.  I grateful for that you let me come, you will never be able to guess how happy I was when you say we're coming to canada. I don't when will you be able to read it, maybe you wouldn't be able to read it at all, it all depends if we have that luck. </p>

<p> Anyways, I moved 3 schools in 3 years, don't get me wrong I move because my house is rent and whenever the rent is due we had to move to a different places. I guess this three years had been very hard because we keep moving. This year is different, we brought house in Laurelwood, and that mean we can stay here until I go to university. Everyone in Laurelwood is nice and of course today I'm going to write some important events that had happen this year</p>
